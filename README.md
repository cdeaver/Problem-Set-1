####Feedback:
This assignment was easy to understand the concepts, but the implementation proved more difficult than expected.  One problem was creating the array with the percentages, and the other was comparing that to the exact percentages given by the book. 

###Problem Set 1
Creating a simulation experiment of two die being rolled.  The goal is to find the number of rolls required to make the percentages (chances) of rolling a number between 2 and 12 the same as the exact chances given by the book.
